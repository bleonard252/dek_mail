Hello and welcome to the Dekyon Mail project!

Feel absolutely free to send pull requests.

The branches and the rules:

Branch|Rules
:--|:--
Master|Don't push to master. Team members will push when the bugs are clear.
Indev|Any development changes should be pushed here. **USE THIS BRANCH.**
Beta/Prerelease|This is for fixing bugs and adding to betas. Beta/Beta should be pushed to Beta/Prerelease when it's needed.
Beta/Beta|Some indev versions can be pushed here. This should always be updated to match Master when a release is made.

## Releases
When I'm releasing, I'll push to master, then make the release. The release will contain a changelog based on the commit from indev to master.
