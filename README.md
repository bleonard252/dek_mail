# `PROJECT CANCELLATION NOTICE`
## Dekyon Mail was cancelled because of the incapability to directly send mail from the browser; a server would be required. Due to our web-app-only architecture we intend to run on, we cannot do Dekyon Mail. Sorry for any inconveniences. If you want to revive Dekyon Mail, fork the repository and, if it is capable of running with just more than our current active users (as evidenced by GitHub), let us know of this via the email on our organization page. Thank you for your cooperation.
## Please note: our Design Goals here are the basis of those we will use in the rest of our Dekyon services. 

# Dekyon Mail
Dekyon Mail is a **cancelled** service where you can sign in to any of your email inboxes right from your browser. You can access any number of email inboxes.

<!-- Not a feature: we will host on GitHub, but if it comes to it, IPFS can and will be used. -- We will host the product's assets on IPFS. Visitors to Dekyon Mail will help uphold its resources by pinning them via JavaScript. -->

## Design Goals
* [ ] Two panels, separately scrolling (desktop)
* [ ] Compatibility for two display modes for small screens (phones) that correspond to the panels on the desktop view
* [ ] A tabbed interface for the second panel
* [ ] A separate header
* [ ] A dimmed wallpaper to display behind the mail list panel
* [ ] A consistent, documented/documentable design
* [ ] Accessibility features

Later, we can open our own decentralized mail server and add customization features.

## Development organization
Files should follow a clear standard of organizing. Compilation should **ABSOLUTELY NOT** be used under **ANY** circumstances.
