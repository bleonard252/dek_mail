# Dekyon Mail
Dekyon Mail is an upcoming service where you can sign in to any of your email inboxes right from your browser. You can access any number of email inboxes.

We will host the product's assets on IPFS. Visitors to Dekyon Mail will help uphold its resources by pinning them via JavaScript.

## Design Goals
* [ ] Two panels, separately scrolling (desktop)
* [ ] Compatibility for two display modes for small screens (phones) that correspond to the panels on the desktop view
* [ ] A tabbed interface for the second panel
* [ ] A separate header
* [ ] A dimmed wallpaper to display behind the mail list panel
* [ ] A consistent, documented/documentable design
* [ ] Accessibility features

Later, we can open our own decentralized mail server and add customization features.

## Development organization
Files should follow a clear standard of organizing. Compilation should **ABSOLUTELY NOT** be used under **ANY** circumstances.
